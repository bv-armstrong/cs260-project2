# CS260 Creative Project 2

This project uses the free API found at http://deckofcardsapi.com/ to manage a deck of cards, used to play a simple version of the game Scum.
It should be noted that the use of the API without a custom back-end limits the functionality of the web app, and introduces plentiful opportunities to cheat.
As such, the app is designed to be played with those in the same room, who are either honest or lack the technical knowledge to cheat.
